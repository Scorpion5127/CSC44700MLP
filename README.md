Made an algorithm/model using machine learning tools such as sequential model LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) 
model, a (RNN), and KNN (K-nearest neighbor) provided by keras library to predict stock market changes. 
Applied various approaches to validate and optimize results by experimenting with different training data sizes, selecting 
specific data segments and time periods for prediction, and evaluating the effectiveness of different training models.
